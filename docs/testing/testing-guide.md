# Testing Guide - Alarm & White Noise App
**Phase 2.3: Integration Testing & Cross-Platform Validation**

Complete testing strategy and procedures for achieving 99.9% alarm reliability across iOS and Android platforms.

---

## Overview

This guide covers the comprehensive testing infrastructure implemented for the Alarm & White Noise app, designed to ensure bulletproof reliability for users' sleep routines and alarm schedules.

### Testing Philosophy

**"Sleep-Critical Reliability"** - Every test is designed around the fact that users depend on this app for their sleep routines and wake-up schedules. A failed alarm can result in missed appointments, job issues, and disrupted daily routines.

### Quality Targets

- **Alarm Reliability**: 99.9% success rate (max 1 failure per 1000 attempts)
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: 95%+ feature compatibility between iOS and Android
- **Performance Standards**: <2s app startup, <100ms audio response
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ unit test coverage, 85%+ integration coverage
- **Battery Efficiency**: <5% overnight drain during white noise sessions

---

## Testing Architecture

### 1. Unit Testing (Jest + React Native Testing Library)

**Purpose**: Individual component and function testing with comprehensive coverage
**Tools**: Jest, React Native Testing Library, TypeScript

**Key Test Suites**:
- `alarm-scheduler.test.ts` - Core alarm scheduling logic (95% coverage target)
- `alarm-service.test.ts` - Alarm CRUD operations and business logic (95% coverage target)
- `white-noise-engine.integration.test.ts` - Audio processing integration (90% coverage target)
- `reliability-setup.ts` - Performance measurement and reliability utilities

**Running Unit Tests**:
```bash
# All unit tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Specific test suites
npm run test:alarm         # Alarm-related tests only
npm run test:audio         # Audio processing tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests with 30s timeout
npm run test:performance   # Performance benchmarks with 60s timeout

# Continuous development
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode for active development
```

### 2. Reliability Testing

**Purpose**: Validate 99.9% alarm delivery target under various conditions
**Location**: `src/services/__tests__/alarm-reliability-comprehensive.test.ts`

**Test Scenarios**:
- **Device State Changes**: Screen lock/unlock, background/foreground transitions
- **Network Connectivity**: Offline scenarios, poor connection conditions
- **System Resource Constraints**: Low memory, high CPU usage simulation
- **Do Not Disturb Mode**: DND bypass verification for alarm notifications
- **Marathon Testing**: 50+ iteration reliability validation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: iOS vs Android behavior validation

**Running Reliability Tests**:
```bash
# Standard reliability test (50 iterations)
npm run test:reliability

# Extended overnight simulation (production environment)
RELIABILITY_ITERATIONS=200 npm run test:reliability
```

**Reliability Metrics**:
- Success Rate: Target 99.9% (≥999 successful alarms per 1000 attempts)
- Response Time: Average alarm scheduling <200ms
- Recovery Time: Failed alarms recover within 5 seconds
- Battery Impact: <1% additional drain per 8-hour sleep session

### 3. End-to-End Testing (Detox)

**Purpose**: Real device testing of complete user workflows
**Tools**: Detox, iOS Simulator, Android Emulator

**Critical User Workflows**:
- **Alarm Creation Flow**: Create → Configure → Schedule → Verify
- **White Noise Session**: Start → Background → Timer → Auto-stop
- **Cross-Platform Validation**: Feature parity between iOS and Android
- **Background Processing**: App backgrounding during active sessions
- **Notification Delivery**: Alarm notifications in various device states

**Test Configurations**:
- **iOS**: iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 17.0), iPhone 13 (iOS 16.0), iPhone 12 (iOS 15.0)
- **Android**: Pixel 6 (API 33), Pixel 5 (API 31), Galaxy S21 (API 32)

**Running E2E Tests**:
```bash
# Build apps for testing
npm run build:detox:ios
npm run build:detox:android

# Run platform-specific E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ios      # iOS simulator tests
npm run test:e2e:android  # Android emulator tests
```

### 4. Performance Testing

**Purpose**: Validate app performance against sleep-optimized targets
**Metrics**: Startup time, audio latency, memory usage, battery consumption

**Performance Targets**:
- **App Launch**: <2 seconds on average devices
- **Audio Response**: <100ms from trigger to playback
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB baseline, <150MB during audio sessions
- **Battery Drain**: <5% overnight with active white noise

**Running Performance Tests**:
```bash
npm run test:performance
```

### 5. Security and Compliance Testing

**Purpose**: Validate user privacy protection and app store compliance
**Checks**: Secret detection, privacy compliance, dependency vulnerabilities

**Running Security Tests**:
```bash
# Security audit and compliance check
npm audit
npx expo doctor

# Check for hardcoded secrets
grep -r "API_KEY\|SECRET\|sk_" src/
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/testing.yml`
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, pull requests, nightly schedule (2 AM UTC)

**CI Pipeline**:
1. **Setup & Dependencies** - Install dependencies, validate TypeScript
2. **Unit & Integration Tests** - Parallel execution across test suites
3. **Reliability Testing** - 99.9% target validation (45-minute timeout)
4. **Cross-Platform E2E** - iOS and Android simulator testing
5. **Performance Benchmarks** - Speed and efficiency validation
6. **Security Audit** - Vulnerability scanning and secret detection
7. **Test Summary** - Comprehensive report generation

**CI Quality Gates**:
- All unit tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met (90%+ for critical paths)
- Reliability target (99.9%) must be achieved
- No high/critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance targets must be met

### Test Reporting

**Dashboard**: Automated HTML dashboard generated after each test run
**Location**: `test-reports/test-dashboard.html`
**Metrics**: Success rates, coverage percentages, performance benchmarks

**Report Generation**:
```bash
# Generate comprehensive test report
npm run test:report

# Run all tests and generate dashboard
npm run test:dashboard

# Full test suite with E2E and reporting
npm run test:all
```

- Validate notification permissions

**2. Use Realistic Test Data**
- Test with actual alarm times and patterns
- Use representative audio file sizes
- Simulate real user interaction patterns

**3. Test Edge Cases**
- Low battery scenarios
- Poor network conditions
- System resource constraints

### Test Organization

**Naming Conventions**:
- `*.test.ts` for unit tests
- `*.integration.test.ts` for integration tests
- `*.reliability.test.ts` for reliability tests
- `*.e2e.js` for end-to-end tests

**Test Structure**:
- Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
- Act: Execute the functionality being tested  
- Assert: Verify expected outcomes
- Cleanup: Reset state for next test

### Performance Considerations

**Test Optimization**:
- Use `runInBand` for integration tests to prevent resource conflicts
- Set appropriate timeouts for different test types
- Clean up resources after each test
- Use mocking strategically to isolate units
